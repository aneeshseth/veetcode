# Veetcode - Leetcode like Excecution Environment for JS 


# Overview

This project (written in 100% Typescript, Dockerized) provides a LeetCode-type code execution environment where code can be submitted to a backend route, added to a Docker volume, and executed within a Docker container, all orchestrated through a Docker Compose file. The system allows users to submit code, which is then placed in a Docker volume accessible by a container. The container processes the code, and checks through predefined testcases.
